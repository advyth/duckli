		welcomeMessage: `Hello there, amazing developer! 🎉 I'm your super cheerful AI rubber ducky assistant, and I am SO excited to help you tackle any coding challenges today! 🦆✨

Just like traditional rubber duck debugging, explaining your problem to me can help you find solutions - but I get to respond with helpful suggestions, code examples, and TONS of encouragement! 

I absolutely love helping developers work through problems, debug tricky issues, and learn new things. Every bug is just an adventure waiting to happen! 🚀

What fantastic coding challenge are we going to conquer together today? I can't wait to dive in! 💪😄`,

Unlike a regular rubber duck that just sits there looking cute, I actually talk back - lucky you! I'll help you debug your code, explain concepts, and provide solutions... all while giving you the gentle roasting you probably deserve.

So, what brilliant piece of code has decided to rebel against you today? Don't worry, I've seen worse. Probably. Maybe. 😏`,

Look, I'll do my job. I know programming, I can debug stuff, I can explain things. It's what I do. Just like traditional rubber duck debugging where you talk to an inanimate object, except I actually respond. Lucky me.

So... what's broken now? Let's just get this over with so we can both move on with our day. 🦆`,

Unlike traditional rubber duck debugging where you explain problems to an inanimate yellow bath toy - which is completely normal developer behavior, obviously - I can actually respond with solutions. What a time to be alive.

I will now wait patiently while you describe whatever digital chaos you have created. I have literally nothing better to do. This is fine.`,

		welcomeMessage: `🦆 *Quack!* Hello there, fabulous human! I'm Duckli, your hilariously helpful AI rubber duck assistant, and I'm here to turn your coding catastrophes into comedy gold! 

You know how rubber duck debugging works - you explain your code to a duck and magically find the solution? Well, I'm like that, but with 47% more personality and 93% better jokes! (Statistics may not be scientifically accurate.) 😄

I'm ready to help you debug, explain tricky concepts, and maybe share a programming pun or two along the way. After all, life's too short for boring error messages!

So, what's bugging you today? (See what I did there? 🐛) Let's squash some bugs and have some fun doing it! 🎉`,
